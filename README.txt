main.py - running "python main.py" will:
	train a DQN with Default Hyperparameters and plot results.
	train a DQN with a set of different Hyperparameters and plot results.
	plot results of both runs combined.
	
this zip contains in addition to code 4 folders:
	first_run_default_param
	second_run_default_param
	first_run_my_param
	second_run_my_param
	
each folder contains:
	pickle file with network parameters at the end of training (example- Q_params.pkl)
	pickle file with target parameters at the end of training (example- target_Q_params.pkl)
	last video recorded of the DQN playing
	

all relevant plots and information is detailed in the RL-project-Report.pdf file.
